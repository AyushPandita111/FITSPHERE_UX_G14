https://www.figma.com/proto/onFbyNDCdGKDkTEiPraNZg/FItsphere?node-id=61-7712&p=f&t=yA0zOjOaus9TBvQH-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=29%3A2063&starting-point-node-id=267%3A13686
The animation of the logo page will not work on browser if you open the link directly from here . It would show only if prototype is started through high fidelity in the Figma App
